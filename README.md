<h2>Our Mission</h2>

Our goal is to create an application that will guide food banks to use commonly found foods to create nutritional meals for low income individuals in King County.

This solution works specifically to address the United Nations 2nd Sustainable Development Goal: Zero Hunger. In 2020, more than 30% of the world’s population were either moderately or severely suffering from food insecurity (United Nations). With the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of people undergoing hunger have been rising, but especially for children (United Nations). 

Throughout the first ten months of 2022, the number of King County families visiting food pantries and receiving assistance from Washington state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) increased (King County). This trend suggests a rise in individuals from King County suffering from food insecurity.

## Testing Protocols
|  | Feature 1: Food List Filtering | Feature 2: Interactive Meal Cards |

The food list will display the food cards reflecting the selected categories immediately. | Each meal card has a button “See Details” that can be clicked on to expand the popup. This expanded pop-up card would show the nutrition facts for the meal and a list of the ingredients used in the meal. Users should be able to retract the pop-up card by clicking an ‘X’ in the top left corner. |
